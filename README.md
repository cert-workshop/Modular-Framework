# Modular-Framework

We are currently working towards establishing a broad and parallel way for the team to work together. Previously Bones (the robot dog we designed and made) was exciting but ultimately had limitations on involvement and high demands at different stages of the project.

The modular framework should enable a larger number of concurrent activity and provide less 'blockers' for others progress. We will be starting with one work-in-progress platform and one pre-made, working our way up to minimal systems and payloads and mission planners. At that stage people can use the frameworks and accumulated team knowledge to expand laterally. For example, much like the Mars rovers we can specify requirements of payloads. An air sampler might need 1 watt-hour, at location X, for 3 minutes, and this payload can try achieving a goal as part of a mission schedule. 

Currently we are organising things, preparing, salvaging a pioneer robot, and integrating ROS2... going off track and learning new things (but thatâ€™s ok as we don't have a deadline). This group is designed to be low pressure, skill share and enabling self-learning, but we do pursue novel research in a pick & mix style and at a gradual pace.
